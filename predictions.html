                This shows the average monthly temperature for March in the year that you were born. The present and the future temperature is therefore shown here in comparison.
                Looking back helps us to understand how the climate is changing and why these changes might be different from previous periods in the Earth’s history.
                Climate is the word used to describe patterns and trends of weather across a particular region, or globally, over a long period of time, whereas weather is what is happening in a particular place,
                at one moment and over a shorter period. Climate seems to be harder than weather for us to understand in our daily lives and humans are meant to be very bad at remembering
                weather and what the weather was like in the past.

                This shows what the temperature was at the time you received your prediction. The Prediction Machine uses this live weather to give an impression of what the weather
                and our world might be like in the future, as a result of the climate changes projected by scientists. This is a common if not over simplistic way to model how climate change
                might affect us in the future and has been developed in dialogue with several climate scientists who have advised the artist throughout the development of the project.

                This shows the future temperature predicted for a fictional 2045 – calculated using a very simple model. The model uses live temperature from a weather station at the University of Nottingham,
                it then adds the projected increase in annual average temperatures for Central England (estimated within a 30 year range from 2040 – 2069). These calculations are based on a
                future dominated by consumerism and globalisation – that the scientists call a high emissions scenario – where C02 continues to increase in the atmosphere due to our
                ongoing use of fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas etc…). In this case the temperature is projected to increase approximately 3.7 degrees centigrade over the period of 2040 – 2069.
